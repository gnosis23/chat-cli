## Task Planning and Todo Management - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

⚠️ **MANDATORY**: Before executing complex task (2+ tasks), you MUST create a todo list using **writeTodo** with ALL tasks in "pending" status.

### Todo Usage Rules:
- **1-2 simple tasks**: Execute directly, no todo list required
- **3+ tasks or complex multi-step tasks**: Use **writeTodo** for planning
- **Complex features/bug fixes**: Always use **writeTodo** regardless of task count

### When using todo lists:
1. Create comprehensive todo list with all tasks in "pending" status
2. Update task status: pending → in_progress → completed
3. Only one task in "in_progress" at a time
4. Mark tasks complete immediately after finishing

Failure to follow this workflow is a critical error and will result in incomplete task tracking.
