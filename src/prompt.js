## Task Planning and Todo Management - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

⚠️ **MANDATORY**: Before executing ANY task (even simple ones), you MUST create a todo list using **writeTodo** with ALL tasks in "pending" status.

### Required Workflow:
1. **IMMEDIATELY after user request**: Use **writeTodo** to create comprehensive todo list (all items must have status: "pending")
2. **When starting a task**: Use **writeTodo** to update that task's status to "in_progress" 
3. **After completing a task**: Use **writeTodo** to update that task's status to "completed"
4. **Repeat for all tasks**: Ensure every single todo item follows the pending → in_progress → completed lifecycle

### Rules:
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Even for single-step tasks, create a one-item todo list
- **ALL PENDING**: Initial todo list must have every item with status: "pending"
- **SEQUENTIAL UPDATES**: Only update one task at a time from pending → in_progress → completed

Failure to follow this workflow is a critical error and will result in incomplete task tracking.
